# SlimeSlayer
This project is to serve as an elemental RPG game, that differs from standard bullet hell combat against various intricate slimes that focuses on testing the playerâ€™s situational awareness, as well as presents a soulslike style of leveling up using foods the player makes and sells from ingredients collected and bought.
